# jsonc

jsonc is a small library that parses and works with json. There are many libraries available, many that likely implement json better than this one, however this project is good practice.

## Building

jsonc only requires the standard c library, and uses CMake, so it should work on just about any system.

### \*nix

    $ git clone "https://github.com/desolt/jsonc" && cd jsonc
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    # make install

### Arch Linux

AUR package coming soon...
